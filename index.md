I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Sciences at the University of Cincinnati. My advisors are Dr. Anil Jegga and Dr. Ali A. Minai. I achieved my Master's degree at the University of Cincinnati in December 2018 under the same advisors. During my Master's thesis, my research focussed on identifying and characterizing drug-drug interactions (DDI) using machine-learning methods. My research interests are in graph neural networks, knowledge representation learning, and computational drug discovery.
